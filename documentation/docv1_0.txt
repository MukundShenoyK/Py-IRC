Simple IRC Server

To send messages pertaining to different behaviour, various codes are used:
0 -> join group
1 -> broadcast message
2 -> multicast message
3 -> privage message to some specific user
4 -> register

Flow:
Start the server by - python server_working.py (port by default is 12345, and listens on all interfaces)
Start the client by - python eclient.py <hostname> <port> <name> (note that hostname and port here are of server)
User gets registered in when starting the eclient.py (note <name> in previous step), so no need to register again
0 some_group_name -> this will allow user to join some group
 - if group is not there it is created
 - all the members of group are send message that particular user has joined the group
2 some_group_name "message" -> this will send message to all members of some_group_name
3 some_user_name "message" -> this will send private message to user some_user_name
1 ?? ?? -> currently broadcast functionality is not proper
